Bluefriend Sniffer support for Scapy
====================================

How to install
--------------

1. git clone this github repository

   $ git clone https://github.com/sysdream/bluefriend-scapy.git

2. install (requires root privileges)

   # cd bluefriend-scapy
   # python setup.py install


How to use
----------

Simply import Scapy and then bluefriend-scapy:

    from scapy.all import *
    import bluefriend_scapy

The module will register all the required classes, and you should
be able to parse a PCAP file generated by the Adafruit's Bluefriend sniffer:

    packets = rdpcap('capture.pcap')

If an error is reported by Scapy saying "unknown LL type [157]", then the installation may have failed.
